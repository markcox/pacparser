HOW TO BUILD
============
1) Prepare your environment.  The default build targets .NET 2.0. You must have VS2008 and VS2010 installed to build successfully.  To build with a newer version of .NET or without VS2008, change the Platform Toolset as described here: http://stackoverflow.com/a/8864294/347155.
2) Open the sln file with VS2010+.
3) Build the solution by pressing F6.
